# terraform-with-aws
In this project, I explored how to host a basic static website in the cloud using Terraform and AWS S3, aiming to simplify the deployment process through automation.

Instead of manually setting up the infrastructure, I used Terraform scripts to define everything neededâ€”such as the S3 bucket, website settings, access policies, and file uploads. This approach turned a potentially time-consuming task into a quick, repeatable process.

By automating the creation and configuration of cloud resources, I was able to deploy a fully functional website in just a few steps. It demonstrates how anyone with basic technical skills can manage cloud infrastructure more efficiently using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

How to use Terraform to automate AWS infrastructure setup.

How to configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.

The benefits of avoiding manual steps for faster, error-free deployment.
